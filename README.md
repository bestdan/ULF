"Useful little functions" in R

This is a compilation of short-hand functions, or convenience functions I've found it useful to have over the years. 
They include very generic functions like round2 and round0, which round numbers to 2 or zero decimal places. 

And very specific investing functions, like mvfrontier, which creates a mean-variance frontier. 

It has not been uploaded to CRAN, so this is the only public place to find it.
